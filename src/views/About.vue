      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>High school started in Aalst for me, more specifically VTI-Aalst. Since the computer science course that I wanted to follow did not start until the third grade, I followed industrial science for a few years. This gave me a good base in Mathematics and Elektronics, the mechanics and fysics part of the course was also really interesting for me.</p>
      <p>After doing my first 4 years on VTI-Aalst, it was time to start my computer science course. Since VTI-Aalst did not offer this course and I wanted to change my commute, I went to Lyceum Gent to follow it.</p>
      <p>After high school came graduate school. My chose went out to Howest Brugge, here I learned the way of the Software engineer.</p>
