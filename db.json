      "description": "<p> When you first start looking at this site, you might wonder: \"How did this amazing site came into existence\". Well that's exactly what this blogpost is about.</p> <p> This site is made using Vuejs, an open-source, model-view front-end Javascript framework, which I learned using the online Vue Mastery Course. Using Vuejs enables you to make more modular websites with reusable components. On this website you will be able to find my personal expierences with events, educaitons, courses, and more.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>Recently I followed the Vue mastery courses. These are paid online courses you can follow to educate or improve yourself in Vuejs.</p> <p> In my opinion these courses are defintly worth the money. They are well diversed, split up, downloadable and teach you a lot of stuff. The courses are centered about small project which you can code along with. If you fall behind you can download the solution from their Git so you can not get stuck on a problem.</p>",

      "description": "<p> All out of the sudden I got an invite from PlanetTalent to join their online conference about AI. I decided to join it since the session was given by Florentijn, a member of ML6.</p><p>The talk started with an explaination about ML6 and what they did. Next he gave an overview of the different type of machine learnings. What I liked the most was the part that came after this.</p><p>A large part of the presentation was about use cases ML6 did, for example recognizing the players and ball in a football game. This gave me a better view of what machine learning and AI are actually about. For this reason I would recommend this kind of talks to students who are thinking of starting a study about AI.</p><p>After the presentation there were a few minutes reserve for a Q&A. I toke this chance to ask about the football project and how they solved the issue of having different camera angles. By my suprise he gave a short but clear answer, which is always nice.</p>",
